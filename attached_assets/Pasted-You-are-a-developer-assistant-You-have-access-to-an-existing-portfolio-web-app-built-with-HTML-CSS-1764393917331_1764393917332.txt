You are a developer‐assistant. You have access to an existing portfolio web app built with HTML, CSS, JS + Express + MongoDB. Your job: **refactor & complete** the site to make it fully production-ready for freelance web-development clients. Do the following:

1. **Remove fake placeholder content**  
   - Change “based in San Francisco, 5+ years experience, 50+ projects, 100% satisfaction” to honest info: student in Surat, mention you are learning/ building, experience as college projects or personal/hobby projects — do not exaggerate.  
   - Remove or rework generic testimonials (“Alex Johnson”, etc.) — either remove the section or mark as “Coming soon — real testimonials here when available.”  

2. **Populate Tech Stack & Skills Section**  
   - Add a clearly visible “My Tech Stack / Skills” section listing actual technologies you know: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, basic DB handling, deployment, Git, etc.  
   - Optionally show icons/logos for each technology for visual clarity.

3. **Implement real Projects / Portfolio Data**  
   - Use MongoDB + backend to store actual projects.  
   - Add at least 2–3 real projects (even small or student-level) with: Title, description, tech stack, live-demo link (if possible), GitHub link, screenshot(s) or image.  
   - Ensure “Featured Projects” no longer shows “Loading projects…” but real cards populated via fetch.  

4. **Secure Admin / Backend Features**  
   - Ensure “Admin” link is protected behind proper login + JWT auth (as you planned). If currently open, fix security.  
   - Add backend route handlers for: add/edit/delete projects, fetch messages, etc.  
   - Make sure contact form stores messages to DB and sends email via nodemailer, and shows success feedback to user.  

5. **Polish UI / UX / Branding**  
   - Add a personal logo or name styling + favicon — not just “Rishi .”. Give identity.  
   - Ensure consistent typography (e.g. Montserrat for headings, Inter for body), spacing, color palette (purple → blue gradient or any clean gradient you chose).  
   - Ensure responsive design: test on mobile & tablet; navigation menu becomes hamburger on small screens; sections stack appropriately.  
   - Clean up navigation: ensure links work, active link highlight, smooth scroll/scroll-to sections or proper routing.  

6. **Add SEO & Accessibility Basics**  
   - Add meaningful `<title>`, `<meta description>`, proper headings (H1, H2…), alt text for images.  
   - Ensure images optimized for size; ensure color contrast for readability; ensure form inputs accessible (labels, placeholders).  

7. **Honest & Transparent Branding**  
   - On “About Me,” write simple honest story: e.g., “Second-semester B.Tech student from Surat, learning full-stack web dev, building portfolio & real projects.”  
   - Avoid unrealistic numbers / claims. Show willingness to learn, adapt, build.  

8. **Fallbacks & Error Handling**  
   - Add 404 page for missing routes.  
   - For backend API: handle errors gracefully; send user-friendly error messages.  
   - For contact form: validate inputs; prevent spam / injection (basic sanitization).  

9. **Deployment / README / Instructions**  
   - Update README to describe real state: what works, what features exist, what to expect when someone contacts you.  
   - Ensure `.env` usage (for email credentials, secrets) is documented.  
   - Provide instructions to run server, build, deploy.  

10. **Optional Enhancements (If time permits)**  
    - Add light/dark mode toggle.  
    - Add simple analytics (e.g., count of page visits stored in DB or third-party) to show “traffic” to clients.  
    - Add a “Coming Soon / Under Construction” placeholder for future AI-agent / automation services (without misleading clients).  

**Goal:** turn this skeleton/placeholder site into an honest, usable, credible portfolio — one that you as a student can confidently share with clients or recruiters.
